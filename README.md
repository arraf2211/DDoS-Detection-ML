Detecting if a network flow is a DDoS attack or not using graph kernels with Machine Learning

Ensure that the packages and libraries are installed, especially GraKel, this can be done by running the very first cell.

Ensure that the dataset are also loaded in correctly, when run, the amount of data in each dataset should be outputted. 

This model was worked upon on a notebook which had access to 30GB of RAM, ensure that the device which is running this has more or equal the amount.

When running the models, for test-train, make sure that the cell containing the graph creation is run, before the OVR and OVO cells. 

The same is said for cross validation, make sure that the cross validation cell for graph creation is run, this is different to the test-train graph creation. 

To note: The model will take roughly 20-25mins to run
